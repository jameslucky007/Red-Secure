              Cyber criminals are continuously targeting enterprise applications, mobile applications and APIs. A web application and API penetration testing helps to simulating attacks on a system in an attempt to gain access to sensitive data or misuse resources. The overall testing process helps with the purpose of determining whether a system is secure. The tests are performed internally or externally on a system, and helps to find information about the target system, identify vulnerabilities within them. RedSecure Penetration Testing helps in following ways: ·    Assess security of your externally published applications and APIs.·    Identifies vulnerabilities in applications or vulnerable routes in infrastructure·    Confirms with security policies whether they have any weaknesses.·    Comply with regulatory and internal compliance requirements.

              <h2>Best Security Practices designed to beat systems before attackers do it</h2>
              <p>“Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility,and it boils down to this: In Cybersecurity,The more systems we secure, The more secure we all are” <br /><br />

All organizations are just a single data breach away from being the lead story on the news and social media, which can severely damage an organization’s brand reputation. Regular security assessments helps in identifying your most significant vulnerabilities. You can thus focus on targeting opportunities for improvement that offer the highest return on investment.
<br /><br />
 Security Practices provides key “inputs” of a security roadmap; where a thorough cyber security assessment via VAPT evaluates your organization’s technology, policies, and awareness.
 <br /><br />
In order to understand the security needs of an organization, it is important to study in depth the organization’s profile and its vulnerable areas. Red Secure’s VAPT Security Assessment Services delivers the best possible service by using a combination of standardized methodologies along with its own internal processes.
<br /><br />
Our security assessment consists of a number of key areas. The primary one is to create a core assessment team followed by other steps such as reviewing the existing security policies, understanding the threat areas and vulnerabilities, estimating the impact, penetration testing and social engineering.

              <h2>What is the level of Cybersecurity Awareness in your Team?</h2>
              <p>The latest reports reveal that the overall number of data breaches (1,862) was up by 68% compared to 2021, and that 33% comprised of phishing, smishing, or BEC attacks. Ransomware was next in line on the threat list, accounting for 22% of all cyberattacks and breaches. Statistics such as these discussed in cybersecurity news items might be overwhelming and make you feel vulnerable and unable to prevent them. But even learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity may make a significant impact.
              <br /><br />
The month of October is marked as the National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM). In an effort to increase awareness, the various governments and the cybersecurity sector have collaborated to promote digital security education and provide everyone with the tools they need to protect their personal information from online crimes.
<br /><br />
Each member of your team should be aware and play a supportive role in strengthening cybersecurity. Multi-factor authentication, use of strong passwords and a password manager, identify and report phishing, and regular upgradation of software are the major aspects to focus on.
<br /><br />
Being a Cyber Security consultant we have linked a very well crafted public tool kit provided by CISA, USA. This toolkit will help you provide your organization with the tools and resources to learn the basics of cybersecurity to your end users. It contains information about the national campaign in October, as well as resources for getting the word out. You are encouraged to use any resource in this toolkit.

              <h2>Only Attacks Can Help You Avoid Attacks</h2>
              <p>“Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it boils down to this: In Cybersecurity,
The more systems we secure, The more secure we all are” 
<br /><br />
How many times have we seen that an organization comes to know about its cybersecurity loophole only after it was attacked. All recent big breaches had this scenario.
<br /><br />
Till the time adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in people, processes or technology, organizations have no idea of those vulnerabilities.
<br /><br />
Are you sure your organization does not fall into that category?
<br /><br />

Only through the offensive approach of cybersecurity wherein you launch targeted attacks on your systems you would know about the loopholes of your cybersecurity.
<br /><br />
Red Secure’s VAPT and Extended Detection and Response and its managed services help you find out all your loopholes through attacks before an actual cyberattack.
<br /><br />
Our Penetration Test helps you act like an attacker, know the loopholes in the system and help your security team to fix those loopholes.
<br /><br />
It includes:
<br /><br />
Vulnerability Management
Cloud Security Posture Management
DevSecOps
Red Teaming
RedOps
Breach and Attack Simulations
Managed Detection & Response Service (addon, separately billable) 
Let us have a meeting to know hidden threats in your systems to protect you from an actual cyberattack.
